1. SeriesEpisode Equals() method
2. Series ValidateEpisodes() When I look for already existing episodes in new Set should I throw an Exception if there is at least one 
   OR should I skip duplicate episodes and add those which are new without Exception?
3. Should Series Series getter return new(Series) object of the class (copy) to be unmodiffiable outside of the class or not?
4. Series RemoveEpisode() Is having at least one element in the list is still necessary??
5. Are there any necessary fields or mandatory attributes to be included in the constructor?? (For instance, ActorsCast in the Movie.cs constructor??)
